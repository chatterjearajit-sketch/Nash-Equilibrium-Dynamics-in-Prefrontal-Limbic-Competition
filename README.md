# Nash-Equilibrium-Dynamics-in-Prefrontal-Limbic-Competition
This repository has code for a paper in Cognitive Control and looks at modeling Stochastic Neural Dynamics. Each file is designed to be run on Google Colab as a standalone file in Python. The name of the paper is "Nash Equilibrium Dynamics in Prefrontal-Limbic Competition: A Stochastic Game Theory Framework for Cognitive Control".
